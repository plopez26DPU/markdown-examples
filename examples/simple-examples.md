# Heading Elements
* The symbol `#` will render different heading sizes, depending on how many symbols used.

`# Headings1` renders as
* # Headings1
  * Notice how H1 headings automatically add the line beneath it

`## Headings2` renders as 
* ## Headings2

`### Headings3` renders as
* ### Headings3

`#### Headings4` renders as
* #### Headings4

## Tips With Heading Elements
* Be sure to give yourself a space between the symbol and your heading text
  * `#Ilovesoup` , is incorrect
  * `# I love soup` , is correct
* If supported by your IDE, the headings are collapsible

# Text Elements
* There are several different options you can alter with text.
* We will just use some basic syntax for this example.

`**Bold Text**` renders as **BoldText**

`*Italicized Text*` renders as *Italicized Text*

You are able to use both the above text emphasis options together. While there are a few different ways of completing this, I believe the easiest to use is `***Bold and Italicized***`.
* I am both ***BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL***

# Quote Elements
This is an element where you can begin to use several different things we have covered thus far.

In general, to create a quoteblock use the `>` symbol

```markdown
> Look at this
> 
> A nice chunk of stuff 
> 
> Do not drop the beans sir.
```
Would get rendered into : 

> Look at this
> 
> A nice chunk of stuff 
> 
> Do not drop the beans sir.

Like I was saying, you can begin to add a few different elements together. 


```markdown
> # That pizza was great
>
> ## Nothing better than not having pineapple on pizza
> ### Who would do that? 
> * *Maybe people who like pineapple?*
> * **MAYBE PEOPLE WHO LIKE PIZZA!**
```
Would be rendered into :
